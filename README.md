# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

The invariant of my `fib()` is that for every loop iteration `fib_i` will be the sum of the previous two numbers in the array. If we wanted to prove the function we could use this for an inductive proof to proof that for every F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). Which is the definition of F(n), where F(n) is the fibonacci sequence.
